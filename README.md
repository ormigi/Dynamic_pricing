# Dynamic_pricing -Demonstrates a rule-based pricing strategy based on competitor trends
As a Data Scientist at SUMMUM, I was tasked with building an analytics dashboard to monitor our hotel's pricing strategy and market positioning. Our competitors, H1 and H2, operate in the same city, and we need to understand how our pricing compares. The goal is to analyze trends, optimize pricing, and stay competitive.

The attached notebook shows how to adjust Hotel room price based on Competition prices for one hotel and two other competitors in the area.

Follow up development:

If we had historical booking data, we could:

ðŸ”¹ Test different thresholds ($15 instead of $20, or $7 instead of $10).

ðŸ”¹ Use A/B testing to see which strategy maximizes revenue.

ðŸ”¹ Apply machine learning models to predict optimal price points.

Algorithms to use:
There are several algorithms that can be used for product price recommendation in dynamic pricing, depending on the specific needs and goals of the business. Here are some common algorithms used in dynamic pricing:

Rule-based algorithms: This is a basic algorithm that uses a set of predefined rules to set prices. For example, if the demand for a product is high, the price could be increased, and if the demand is low, the price could be decreased.
Time-series forecasting: This algorithm uses historical data to forecast future demand and adjust prices accordingly. This approach takes into account seasonal patterns and trends to optimize pricing.
Machine learning algorithms: These algorithms use historical data to learn from patterns and adjust prices based on predictive models. This approach can include techniques such as regression analysis, decision trees, and neural networks.
Reinforcement learning algorithms: This is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses trial and error to optimize pricing. The algorithm makes decisions based on feedback from customer behavior and adjusts prices to maximize profit.
Multi-armed bandit algorithms: This algorithm is used in situations where there are multiple products or pricing options. It uses trial and error to test different pricing strategies and learns which ones are most effective in maximizing profit.
